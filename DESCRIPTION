Title: Nash Equilibrium and Game Theory Toolkit
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Pekka", "Maintainer", email = "pekka@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Research-grade game theory toolkit for R. Covers non-cooperative
    games (Nash equilibrium computation via Lemke-Howson, support enumeration,
    homotopy continuation), cooperative games (Shapley value, core, nucleolus),
    Bayesian games, auction theory, mechanism design, and evolutionary dynamics.
    Performance-critical algorithms implemented in C.
